function d = minDistance_slow(x,y,z)
% Find the min distance between a set of points and origin

nPoints = length(x);
d = zeros(nPoints, 1)  % Preallocate;

for k = 1: nPoints  % Compute distance for every point
    d(k) = sqrt(x(k)^2 + y(k)^2 + z(k)^2);
end

d = min(d);  % Get the minumun distance
